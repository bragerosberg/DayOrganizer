# Contents
A todo-list is helpful and great, but does not provide to much value if not combined usage with other tools. Other relevant tools that help ones day-to-day life could be weather forecasts. Therefor in this project I will take this combination of writing tasks, while observing a current weather situation. To conveniently structure the day, both knowing expected weather, and tasks - at one place.

## Motivation
For this project I am further developing a simple React todo list I have created (click [here](https://github.com/bragerosberg/ReactTodo) to see). Previously I also tested some personal ideas of mine in a *hackday* project (see it [here](https://github.com/bragerosberg/Hackday)) where I used various open APIs which all needed authentication to use. Even though the service and data they provided were absolutely amazing, I wished I could utilize something that does not require authentication so any user can test it out on their device without any unnecessary hassle. 


# Tech Usage and Reasoning
* React
* GraphQL (w/express, nodejs, Apollo)
* MetaWeather API (link [here](https://www.metaweather.com/api/))
